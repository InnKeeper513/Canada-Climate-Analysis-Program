# Canada-Climate-Analysis-Program
Project Designed for geography students

This project collects weather and climate data from all Canada regions, made by a group of 3 people.

Used Java GUI for the main user interface, I designed the loading animations, data analysis, data connections and connecting the user interface to different subpanels. 

The main purpose of designing this program is to learn the skills required to become a software engineer. We've handed in a list of papers aboout the purpose, timeline, schedule, design outlooks, etc. Because the project need to be done in one week time, some parts of the program still requires improvements, including more efficient algorithms.

But this is still my first time being inside a working environment, meeting the clients, hearing their requests and to discuss with groupmates to come up reasonable solutions. It's a very enjoyable experience..
